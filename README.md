# ProCp

During the ProCP we are going to work with Agile Scrum methodology. This means that to deliver the software system, we work on iterations. Each iteration brings new features. In this document we plan the first iteration out of three. 


# Airport simulation

The purpose of this project is to build an application for SIM Software Inc. based on their
requirements. To satisfy their request, we will be developing an application, which would
simulate the best and most efficient way to transport luggage in an airport. Our goal is to
deliver a functional simulation application within the time frame we are given. This will take
place through continuous implementation phases and testing in order to provide the final
version.
